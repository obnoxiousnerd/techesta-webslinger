              Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
              2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served
              as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
              raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
              engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
              science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
              Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
              civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
              He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work
              on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
              technology.

              After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
              Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
              Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
              Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after
              becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service
              (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but
              remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. In 1969,
              Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
              (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first
              Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the
              Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first
              started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO
              in 1965 Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime
              Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development
              Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II
              nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played
              an intensive political and technological role.

              Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The
              Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981
              and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO
              and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997,
              Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna,
              for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation
              of defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the recipient of
              the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize
              excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related
              project". In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's
              poll of the Greatest Indian.

              Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R.
              Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral
              vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi
              Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. On 10
              June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in
              power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for
              the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the
              Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. Kalam said of the
              announcement of his candidature: I am really overwhelmed.
              Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked
              for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the
              people of the country at this juncture.

              On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture
              on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of
              Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
              experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium
              after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes
              into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby
              Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked
              a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the
              intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac
              arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.

              The Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial was built in memory
              of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of
              Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister
              Narendra Modi in July 2017. On display are the replicas of rockets
              and missiles which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about
              his life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits
              depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam
              in the entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two other
              smaller statues of the leader in sitting and standing posture.
